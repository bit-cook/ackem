## What is Ackem?

Ackem is **not** a web chat box. It's a **local-first** Windows desktop application: you bring your own LLM API key (or run a local inference server), and Ackem handles the rest — **conversation, memory, emotion & relationship state, desktop pet companionship** — all while keeping your data on **your own hard drive**.

### What you can do with it

- **Chat like you would with a person** — supports any OpenAI-compatible API (cloud or local Ollama / LM Studio). Configure it in **Settings → Model & API**.
- **It remembers what you talk about** — conversations are written into structured memory. Search, browse timelines, explore the knowledge graph, or **import** your own `.txt` / `.md` files as long-term memory.
- **Continuous companionship** — Ackem maintains trust, mood, relationship stage, and more. Switch between personality presets. Your companion writes its own **diary** and may reach out to chat at the right moment.
- **Not just a window** — minimize to the **system tray**, or open the **desktop pet** window that sits on your screen (currently a geometric orb with Live2D preview).
- **Optional capabilities** — **voice** recognition & TTS, **WeChat** bridge (reply from your phone while the brain runs on your PC), and an **Extension Center** with built-in tools and reminders. **Plan · OpenForU** is an experimental workspace for creating your own extensions.
- **Game mode** — experimental. Play supported games (e.g., Minecraft) alongside your companion, depending on enabled extensions.

### Where your data lives

In portable mode (default for the green release), all personal data goes into the **`data/`** folder next to `Ackem.exe`: chat history, memories, diaries, API keys in settings — **none of it ships with the installer**, and **there is no default telemetry uploading to an Ackem server**. The official zip contains only the application and model resources; an empty `data/` directory is created locally on first launch.

For backup, migration, or full deletion, see [docs/memory-format.md](./docs/memory-format.md) and [docs/distribution-windows.md](./docs/distribution-windows.md).

### What you need

1. A Windows 10/11 64-bit PC  
2. An LLM API key (or a local inference server address)  
3. Extract the green release and wait ~10–30 seconds on first launch (the local embedding model for memory retrieval auto-extracts)

No Node.js or coding skills required.

### For developers

See the **「Developers」** section below, the [architecture docs](#six-system-architecture) and the [document index](#documentation).

## Quick Start (End Users)

For: **downloaded the official Release**, no Node.js needed.

### Privacy (please read)

| The official release **does not include** | After first run, **exists only on your machine** |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Your memories, chats, or imported files | `data/` (portable mode, next to exe) |
| API keys or model credentials | Settings, stored in local userData |
| Any maintainer or third-party private data | What you configure and write yourself |

See [docs/distribution-windows.md](./docs/distribution-windows.md) for details.

### Steps

1. **Download** — Get `Ackem-v1.0.0-win-x64.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JasonLiu0826/Ackem/releases)
2. **Extract** — Unzip fully to an SSD directory (do not run from inside the zip)
3. **Launch** — Double-click `Ackem.exe` or `启动 Ackem.bat`. First launch takes ~10–30 seconds
4. **Configure model** — Enter Base URL, API Key (required for cloud), and Model ID in **Settings**
5. **First chat** — Send a message to confirm the reply. Optionally import `.txt`/`.md` memories

## Developers

> Ackem is an **Electron app**. The renderer process depends on `window.ackem` (preload IPC).  
> Always use **`npm run dev`** to start Electron; do not open the Vite address in a browser alone.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Node.js **20+**
- `npm ci`

### Daily development

```bash
cd Ackem-v0.0.0
npm install
npm run dev
```

During development, `data/` lives in the working directory, independent from the green release's `data/` next to `Ackem.exe`.

### Build & Package

```bash
npm run build          # Compile → out/
npm run dist:green     # Green release → dist/release/
npm run dist:setup     # Optional NSIS installer
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:renderer
```
